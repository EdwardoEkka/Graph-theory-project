Routing Process Overview: If I am transmitting a data from a pc in India to a 

1. Local Network:
   - The data packet originates from your PC within your local network, such as your home Wi-Fi network or organizational 
   intranet.

2. Internet Service Provider:
   - Upon leaving the local network, the data packet is transferred to your Internet Service Provider (ISP).
   - ISP's network infrastructure, including routers, facilitates directing the data packet towards its intended destination.

3. Regional Network:
   - The data packet traverses various network infrastructures owned by different ISPs, both within India and potentially 
   across other countries, based on available routing paths.

4. Transcontinental Links:
   - As the data packet progresses, it may cross over to other continents, typically through undersea cables or satellite 
   links, as it proceeds towards the United States.

5. US ISPs:
   - Upon reaching the United States, the data packet enters the network infrastructure of American ISPs.
   - Within the US network, the packet may navigate through multiple routers as it advances towards the final destination.

6. Destination Network:
   - The data packet eventually reaches the network of the ISP serving the destination PC in California.
   - Within the destination network, the packet undergoes further routing until it is delivered to the destination PC.
