Brief detailing of the components in the dataset:

1. AS (Autonomous Systems):
   - Autonomous Systems (AS) are collections of IP networks and routers under the control of one or more network operators.
   - In the dataset, AS numbers are used to uniquely identify individual Autonomous Systems. AS numbers typically range from 
   1 to a few million.
   - Each AS is associated with a name or label, providing a human-readable identifier for the AS.

2. Edge_ID:
   - Edge_ID serves as a unique identifier for each edge or connection between Autonomous Systems.
   - This identifier distinguishes one connection from another in the dataset.
   - Edge_IDs are used to reference specific connections when analyzing or visualizing the network topology.

3. Source_AS and Target_AS:
   - Source_AS represents the AS number from which the connection originates.
   - Target_AS represents the AS number to which the connection is directed.
   - Together, Source_AS and Target_AS define the endpoints of each connection in the dataset.

4. Link_Type:
   - Link_Type specifies the type of connection or link between Autonomous Systems.
   - Common link types include:
     - Peering: Indicates a direct interconnection between two ASes, typically for the exchange of traffic 
     between their networks without the exchange of money.
     - Transit: Indicates a commercial relationship where one AS (the transit provider) provides network connectivity 
     to another AS (the customer) in exchange for payment.
     - Other possible link types might include "Customer", "Provider", "Private Peering", etc., depending on the specific 
     context and granularity of the dataset.

Overall, this dataset provides information about the connectivity between Autonomous Systems in a network, specifying the 
source and target of each connection, along with the type of relationship between them. It serves as a valuable resource for 
analyzing and understanding the structure and dynamics of internet routing and interconnection.
